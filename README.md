# Software Stacks Installation

## Background
A software stack is a collection of independent components that work together to support the execution of an application. The components, which may include an operating system, architectural layers, protocols, runtime environments, databases and function calls, are stacked one on top of each other in a hierarchy. 

There are acronyms for individual technologies used together for a specific technology product. Some examples areâ€¦
- LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
- LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
- MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
- MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS
